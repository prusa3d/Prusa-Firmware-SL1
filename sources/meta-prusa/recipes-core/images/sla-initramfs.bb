# Simple initramfs image artifact generation for tiny images.
DESCRIPTION = "Tiny image capable of booting a device. The kernel includes \
the Minimal RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs), which finds the \
first 'init' program more efficiently. core-image-tiny-initramfs doesn't \
actually generate an image but rather generates boot and rootfs artifacts \
that can subsequently be picked up by external image generation tools such as wic."
