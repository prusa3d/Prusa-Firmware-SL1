Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: Add timer erratum property for Allwinner A64

Although the Freescale A008585 erratum doesn't apply to Allwinner A64 platform,
the underlying workaround does actually cover the otherwise unrelated timer
instability in the A64, while the workaround designated specifically for A64
actually does not.
