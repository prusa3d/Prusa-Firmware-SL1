This is the final release of firmware 1.6.0, which is the first firmware release with support for both SL1 and the upcoming SL1S SPEED. The firmware is universal and able to automatically recognize between both types of printers and set the system parameters accordingly. Differences between SL1 and SL1S SPEED are described below.

There are major changes to the firmware’s code. Compared to the previous release 1.5.0, there are 689 commits, and 127 bug fixes. Kudos to the community for reporting the issues.

## Detailed description

### User mode UV calibration
Starting this release the system allows for a user recalibration of the UV light intensity using an external UV sensor. Until now, this was possible only in the factory, where both the assembled SL1 printers and printer ktis were calibrated before being shipped. The recalibration is needed every time the 2K printing screen is replaced. The system must set a proper light intensity on the LED in order to achieve the correct level of exposure in the resin tank. Setting an incorrect intensity might under or overexpose the printed object leading to a possible print failure.
To calibrate the UV intensity of the SL1 outside the factory, the developers have created a brand new measuring device, which consists of 15 phototransistors, enabling the printer to measure the intensity in 15 areas and therefore provide a detailed map of the entire print area. First, the intensity is measured in central zones of the screen, then the outer edges are checked.
The calibration is fully automatic, the user only needs to plug the device to the front USB of the SL1, place it on the top of the print display and start the calibration. The entire process won't take more than several minutes.
The UV calibration device is currently being manufactured and will be soon available for preorder in a bundle with a new screen. However, since the device can be used multiple times, the print display will be also available for purchase separately.

### Parallel pre-print checks
To shorten the time before the print is started, some pre-checks now run in parallel. This adjustment saves some time as the hardware setup and logical checks are mostly not blocking each other. A new user interface was created to display all the checks in a unified view.

### Manual check for firmware update
Starting the firmware version 1.3.0 the printer is automatically checking for available updates on the server and displays a notification for the user. Starting this release there is a slight update as the “firmware check” can be also triggered manually from the printer's menu.
An alternative option is to use a USB flash drive and download the firmware using a computer. Stable firmware releases are always available at prusa3d.com/drivers.

## Detailed description

### New web interface
The web interface has been completely redesigned. Now, the page displays the printer's telemetry allowing the user to monitor:
printer status
speed of the fans
status of the cover (lid)
currently printed layer
remaining time of the print
temperatures of the components

For the full list of the features please, access your 3D printer (connected to a local network) via an internet browser. Please note that the page is read-only and does not require any authorization. This enables access from the Apple devices, which were unable to load the page due to a bug in the WebKit browser engine (Safari). A secured version with the ability to control the printer is planned for the future release.

### Software licences updated
The list of the software licences was updated and contains information about the package used in the firmware, its version and respective licence.

## Fixed bugs
- Fixed projects named using numbers only (i.e. "123456789.sl1")
- Fixed fans being disabled during the print process in some cases
- Fixed release notes in new version announcement
- Improved response to network online event
- Fixed calibration model settings

## Detailed description

### New network management
The network is now managed by the NetworkManager. The user interface was updated in order to allow for static address/routes/DNS settings and hidden SSID WiFi networks. Also, the new user interface is more responsive and gives more details while working with WiFi connections.

### Phantom click resistant UI
Critical control paths in the user interface such as print start and print cancel were redesigned in order to be more resistant to phantom touches. This should prevent accidential print cancel on dirty displays.

### New way of system update delivery
As of 1.3 the system updates come with notfications promting the users to install them. This way everyone with the printer connected to the internet will be aware of new the system releases.

### Examples download
An option was added to download example models to the printers internal storage. This allows for downloading fresh examples package that now includes a resin calibration project. This one allows for exposure time optimalization for unknown resins.
